Make the resistance class:
    I want a text box above the resistance.
    You can turn a wire into a resistance by clicking on a wire, it will turn yellow, then you press R.
    If you click anywhere else, or any other key then it gets unclicked.
    The design of the resistor:

    There should be a text box on top of the resistor(note: it is important for the textbox to be ABOVE not below the resistor(you need to figure out how))

    The text box should be tilted at the same angle as the resistor.
Figure out deletion of wires and nodes and resistances.
