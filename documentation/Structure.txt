Various parts are:

The graphics: (Two parts again input and output)

The math: (Does all the calculation)

Basic Program flow:
1. The user constructs the circuit using the graphical interface
2. The UI send the math part the graph to use and then the math part calculates everything and returns an object
   which can be queried to get the results.
3. Now the graphical interface takes more inputs from the user and queries the object returned effectively.

The math part:

It will take in the two node which are represented as a vector.(index is the same as)

Circuit(Class):

Member variables:
    unordered_map<node_identifier, pair<resistance, node_identifier>> circuit_graph;
    vector<int> Node_values;
    double voltage;
    double net_resistance;
    
Member function:
    Constructor();
    //Run only once
    getCurrent(some_way_to_identify_the_edge);
    getVoltage(node_identifier);
